Whatever is best suited to achieve the goal at hand.

##Personal Training

The training Teklabs delivers is done in a one-on-one setting often in comfort of a client's home or business.  We also title this section personal because we believe technology should be personal.  It should serve an individuals needs, wants, and dreams.  Teklabs exists to help people explore, discover, and learn about technology.  We exist to remove the barriers between technology and people.

##Write
I have never really considered myself a writer. That is until I began to write for the love of writing. I excelled in English in school and didnâ€™t know what to do with it. Writing has always been easier for me than speaking. I am currently in beta as a writer. Learning to be disciplined in my writing.
